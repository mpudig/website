## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" alt="avatar">}}

I am a PhD candidate in the Center for Atmosphere Ocean Science ([CAOS](https://caos.cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/)), housed within NYUâ€™s Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. 

I am interested in ocean dynamics and the ocean's role in climate, and seek to build physical understanding through theory and computational modelling of varying complexity. I am particularly motivated by how ocean processes can be better represented in global climate models.
